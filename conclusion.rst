Summary: Important points
_________________________

As websites and web applications are now extremely common, and most organisations
and many private individuals have a web presence, online accounts become more
and more important and valuable.

Most everyday computer software now has moved,
or is progressively moving, to web applications.
Attacks on web applications have the potential of compromising the privacy of
many users very quickly, significantly more than what was possible with worms
that replicated via email in the 90s.

For these reason it is more important than ever that those who are
responsible for designing and implementing web applications have a
thorough understanding of security risks and good practices.

XSS is one of the most common attacks on web applications, and can
lead to disastrous consequences for organisations in terms of responsibilities
and costs, but are also very easy to avoid by enforcing good practices
in the development process.

Moreover, web technologies change quickly and significantly. For example,
the HTML standard evolved significantly and new versions of the standard
have many more functionalities that have quickly been be exploited for
new kinds of attacks. It is therefore of uttermost importance for businesses
and development teams to understand and put in place processes for reviewing
the security aspect of applications periodically, and strengthening it if
necessary.
